# Configurable User-attributes

User-attributes (also called user-data) are free-text values that are accessible through the users own profile page.

Which attributes are available (and how they are named) is a matter of configuration.

You can customize, which attributes are available by editing the file: 
[/consumer/cid{CID}/config/user_attributes.ini](bigace/cid_cid).

Please note, that there is a difference between user-data and user-settings (like language and email address).
