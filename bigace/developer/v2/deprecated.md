# Deprecated Sources

Some of the Sources shipped with BIGACE are deprecated. They are not deleted directly, for update compatibility.

A Error Log Message is thrown, if such a File is in use, so have a look at your Log Files! There is always a short hint added what to do!

There might be more deprecated file than the ones below, the list might not be complete!

Here is a list of deprecated Librarys:

    * /system/libs/applications.inc.php
