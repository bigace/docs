# News-Example

The News-Example is an [Extension](extensions) to the official [News System](extensions/addon/news).

It brings some example Includes and Templates to be used with the News System. After installation, you only have to configure the News System as required and you can start, creating your own small News Website.

The Includes (see below) were made for re-usage, so you can easily extend your own Website without the need of writing own News includes.
