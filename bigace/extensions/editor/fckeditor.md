# FCKeditor (deprecated)

Read the [FCKeditor Manual page](bigace/manual/fckeditor) for more information and external links.

The FCKeditor is a Cross-Browser WYSIWYG HTML Editor, probably one of the most used in the WWW.

The implementation for BIGACE is stable, cause it is the default editor for a long time now.

**NOTE: ONLY compatible with BIGACE 2.4!**

## Installation

When you install this Extension, the Configuration "default.editor" and "fckeditor.toolbar" in the package "editor" will be overwritten!

IMPORTANT: Delete your Browser cache, after you installed a new Version of the FCKeditor, otherwise you might encounter strange problems. This is a problem with cached Javascript files and has nothing to do with BIGACE 8-)

If you still get problems, post them in the Forum with detailed information.


## Changelog

**Version 1.0:**


*  Using latest Version 2.6 beta (probably unstable), including overlay dialogs instead of Pop-Ups

*  Made it available as Extension, for fast integration of new FCKeditor Versions
