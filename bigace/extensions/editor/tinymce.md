# TinyMCE

See the [TinyMCE Editor](bigace/manual/tinymce) page for more information and external links.

The TinyMCE Editor is another Cross-Browser WYSIWYG Editor, in some points better then the default [FCKeditor](bigace/manual/fckeditor).

The implementation for BIGACE is in "development" state, cause its currently not 100% compatible.
It is working, but there is a problem with the Image Preview Dialog, which will be fixed soon.
