## Privacy

There are people outside who afraid of the personal profile data, which could be collected by the Gravatar running company/people.
You should Google for more information and read one or two articles before you activate your account!

The biggest problems: 

*  You cannot delete a once created Gravatar account!

*  You cannot switch your main email address!

The consequence could be, be to create a free email account and register this one as Gravatar. Post with this email account and be happy :)
