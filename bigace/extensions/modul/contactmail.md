# Contact Mail Formular

This modul displays a simple Contact Mail Formular, where User can leave their name, email adress, a title (subject) and a short message.
If you need additional information from your visitor, you can configure further optional fields.

All these informations will be put together and sent via email to a configurable email account (or a list of recipients).

A "Thank you for your message" message will be shown after email was successful sent. If the email could not be delivered, a short info text will be shown.
