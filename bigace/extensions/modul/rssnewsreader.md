# RSS Feed Reader

The RSS News Feed Reader is a BIGACE Modul that replaces the Pages Content by a View on configured RSS Newsfeeds.

The provided Feeds can easily administrated by editing an INI File that looks like this:

	:::ini
	[BIGACE at Sourceforge.net]
	Project Summary = "http://sourceforge.net/export/rss2_projsummary.php?group_id=149865"
	File Releases = "http://sourceforge.net/export/rss2_projfiles.php?group_id=149865"
	
	[News]
	BBC News - Politics [en] = http://news.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_uk_edition/uk_politics/rss091.xml


Edit the available RSS files at **/consumer/cidX/modul/rssNewsReader/rssList.ini**.

All Feeds are cached for performance issues.
