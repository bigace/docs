## Features

Header and right column can be edited in the template. 

Its a one content only template, but could easily be changed to use 3 contents for header, content and right menu.
But as I guess header and menu are site wide, so its left up to you if you make it dynamic.

As logged in user, you get Administration, Editor and Logout buttons in the footer.
