 2.  Could not connect to database using Adapter "Mysqli" : Unknown MySQL server host 'yyyyyyy' (1)
 3.  Message: Could not connect to database using Adapter "Mysqli" : Unknown database 'zzzzzzz'
 4.  Message: Could not connect to database using Adapter "Mysqli" : Access denied for user 'aaaaaaa'@'yyyyyyy' (using password: YES)

... and their explanation:
 1.  set a correct adapter name as xxxxxxx is wrong
 2.  the server yyyyyyy is either not the database server or is not reachable
 3.  the database name zzzzzzz is wrong
