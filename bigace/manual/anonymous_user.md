# Anonymous User

Each un-registered (not logged in) User surfing your Site is treated as anonymous user. The System doesn't know anything about them.

Each anonymous user is seen as the "magic" User **all+**.
The **all+** user is (by default) member of the Usergroup **Anonymous**.

Note: Be careful, if you add the anonymous (**all+**) user to another usergroup, each unregistered user will have their [GroupPermissions](groupPermission) and item rights too!
