# url.lowercase

Package: **[.](.)**

Whether page URLs should be lowercased. To prevent problems with lower- and uppercased characters and duplicate URLs consider to turn it on (using ''TRUE'').

This setting only applies to new page URLs, so you might leave it as is, if you have a running system with a lot of existing (and indexed in terms of search-engines) pages.
