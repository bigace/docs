# word.delimiter

Package: **[.](.)**

The word delimiter for auto-generated page URLs. The delimiter will be used in all parts of the page URL, where special character (most commonly the space but also everything that is not a default ascii character) exist. These special charcter will be replaced by the delimiter. 

In terms of search-engines (for SEO purpose) the hyphen - should be considered to be best practice.
