# show.default.content

Package: **[.](.)**

If a page is requested in a language where no content exists, Bigace can load the content from the default language. This can be useful if you create pages and fill them with content soon afterwards.

But consider turning this off, if you have many empty pages, otherwise you might run into serious SEO (duplicate content) problems.
