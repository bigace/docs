# Designs

(Smarty) Designs are used for rendering your page. They load the configured [template](manual/templates) and [stylesheet](manual/stylesheet) and pass this information to the underlying engine.


*  Download new [Templates and Designs](extensions).

## Default Designs

These Designs are shipped with the each BIGACE installation.

### BIGACE-REDIRECT

This simple design is not a real design, but only a way of forwarding the menu to another URL.
Choose it and enter any full URL (like http://www.google.com/) into the "Catchwords" field.

If a valid URL is given and the page is loaded, a redirect is sent to the browser. Otherwise an short error message is displayed.

### BLIX

This is the default layout provided with the standard BIGACE install. You can find other BIGACE-compatible layouts listed under [](extensions) here on the BIGACE web site. 
For details on installing a downloaded layout, see [](manual/updates).
