# Administration Framework Features

There are four main parts in the administration framework:


*  the header with the BIGACE Logo

*  the toolbar with the language switcher and other quick links

*  the navigation with links to all administration panels

*  the content or admin panel area

The position of all components may be different from the mentioned one, if you use a different [Administration Theme](admin_themes)!

## Language switching

The drop-down box in the upper right corner lets you switch the language to your needs.

## Quick links

There are a couple of useful quick links to make your Admin work a little easier.

### Help - Manual

In each administration panel, you see a **Help** link in the upper-right corner. Click this link to open a new browser window with the requested manual page.

There is also a quick link in the upper menu bar, that brings you to the main page of this manual.

### Logout

The Logout Button in the toolbar quits your User session (logs you off) and opens the website's start page.
