# Layout

The layout administration is the place to manage all installed Layouts. 

*Please note: Other words for "Layout" are "Template" or "Theme"! What is called "Layout" in Bigace might be called different in other software products (there is no standard wording for it).* 

The Layout administration is the place to:


*  See which Layouts are installed

*  Check the currently configured default Layout

*  Check metadata (like path and extended options) of Layouts

*  Edit the Layouts sourcecode
