## History of the "classical" menu administration

The classical menu administration is a left-over from BIGACE 2.3 and earlier. Compared to the [Menu Tree Administration](bigace/manual/menutree) is has a completely different view and handling (Look&Feel), which uses almost no Javascript. Many user find it more easy to navigate the page-tree that way instead using the a explorer-like view, so it was kept and renamed to "classical".
