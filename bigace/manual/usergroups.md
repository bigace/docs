# Usergroups

A Usergroup is a Container for a bunch of User, where each User can be member of several Groups.

[Access permissions on objects (like pages/images)](manual/objectrights) are always given to Usergroups, what makes it easy to show different content to different User.

On the other hand, a Usergroup has a set of [Group Permissions](manual/grouppermission). 
As a User can be member of several Usergroups, you can create any possible combination of [Group Permissions](manual/grouppermission).
