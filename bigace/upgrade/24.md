## .htaccess

If you are using the Rewrite features of BIGACE, you have to use the latest .htaccess files, otherwise you will only receive 404 errors.

SKIP THIS STEP, IF YOU DO NOT USE THE REWRITE FEATURE.

Therefor, copy the files **/misc/install/access/root.htaccess** and rename it to **.htaccess**. Replace the existing .htaccess file in your BIGACE working/root directory.

Please read [this Forum thread](http://www.bigace.de/forum/index.php/topic,136.0.html) (German) and the [.htaccess Administration Guide](bigace/administration/urlrewriting) for further information.

## Search Template

You have to configure your Seatch Templates Header and Footer after the Upgrade, if you do NOT use the default Template (BLIX).

If you used the Search as Popup, you might use the default Includes "APPLICATIONS-HEADER" and "APPLICATIONS-FOOTER", please read [bigace:administration:search](bigace/administration/search) for further informations.

You also have to fix your Search Formular, cause the new search uses different Parameter names!
